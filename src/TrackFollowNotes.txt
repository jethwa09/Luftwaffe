Config 1:
float KP = 1.0f;
float KI = 0.2f; 
float KD = 0.1f; 
Bad Results on Track 2

Config 2: 
float KP = 1.0f; // Proportional Gainfloat 
KI = 0.05f; // Integral gain
float KD = 0.1f; // derivative gain
Good Results on Track 2
Poor results on Track 3

Config 3:
float KP = 0.95f; // Proportional Gain
float KI = 0.03f; // Integral gain
float KD = 0.2f; // derivative gain
Good Results on Track 2
Good Results on Track 3
Some hiccups on track 3 on a corner


Config 4: 
float KP = 0.95f; // Proportional Gain
float KI = 0.05f; // Integral gain
float KD = 0.22f; // derivative gain
Good results on Track 2. 
Having a little difficulty on startup. Changed sample period to 25 ms.


Config 5: 
float KP = 1.0f; // Proportional Gain
float KI = 0.5f; // Integral gain
float KD = 0.2f; // derivative gain
Terrible results on Track 2. Integral gain way too high.

Config 6:
float KP = 0.9f; // Proportional Gain
float KI = 0.03f; // Integral gain
float KD = 0.3f; // derivative gain
Bad results on Track 2.


Config 7: 
float KP = 1.2f; // Proportional Gain
float KI = 0.09f; // Integral gain
float KD = 0.5f; // derivative gain
Good results on Track 3. Doesn't recover if front sensors are off the line.
